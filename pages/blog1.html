                    to my blog! This is my first post to the blog, and it serves to introduce myself and the blog 
                    to anyone who might be reading this.

                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Adrian Curammeng. Here is a picture of me, not a current one, but of when I was 7? Maybe 8?
                </p>

                    I'm a Grade 12 ("sophmore") student at Francis Libermann Catholic High School, and I
                    am studying to become a Computer Programmer. I enjoy everything computers and technology, from programming to video games,
                    as well as listening to music. My favourite artist as of right now (2/23/2023) is Porter Robinson, and my favourite song from
                    his is "Get Your Wish".
                </p>
                <h2>This Blog</h2>
                <p>
                    Along with being a blog documenting my work in my TGJ4M1 (Communication Technology) class, this blog is also a personal 
                    project for me. While preparing to study Computer Programming after highschool, I recently dabbled in web design, creating 
                    websites and all that. When we were assigned this blog assignment, I took the opportunity to also practice my web design skills.
                    So, everything you see in this blog was created all by me (using HTML, CSS and JS). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from playing video games and working on homework/projects, I play the piano. I am also in the FLCHS Concert and Stage Band 
                    as its first trombone (been playing since Grade 7). After I graduate I will study Computer Programming and Analysis at Seneca
                    College as well as (hopefully) transfer my credits to pursue a Bachelor Science in Computer Science in another University.
                </p>
